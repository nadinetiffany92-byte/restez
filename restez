        <p class="msg">Gramz I miss you and I wish you could see what I'm doing now. You left me too soon. I was just a kid—now I'm grown with kids of my own... seven to be exact. The crazy thing is my oldest is about the same age I was the last time I hugged you. Man, how I miss you. You were more than my grandma — you were my homegirl. I remember going cruisin' with you. I was always with you. I would do anything just to have a little more time with you. I know you would've loved my babies so much. Until we meet again, Grama, please keep watching over your beautiful great-grandbabies. My Guardian Angel 💔</p>

        <p class="msg">Unc Ang, it's your Miss Tiff. I love and miss you. The day we got the call, we jumped in my mom's van, and I floored it down Kings Ganyon like a NASCAR driver, scaring the crap outta her. I loved how no matter where I went, I always ran into you. I remember the way we gave each other that look like, “You better not tell.” 🙈🙉🙊

And that time you dropped me off at home in Coco's car — I told you not to pull up all the way, and you did, blasting Rasta music with her system bumpin'. I knew I was caught.

I'll always remember hanging off your arm like I was a dumbbell when I was little. You left too soon, and a piece of me left with you. But you're no longer suffering. Save me a spot up there, Unc — so we can kick it in Thugz Mansion.
♡ Ms. Tiff — my nickname you gave me.</p>

        <p class="msg">I loved how close we'd gotten before you were called home. Those memories I hold close to me. I swear it was “like da movies” (in my Uncle Joe voice). May he rest in peace too.

I love your wild self, Aunty — always spoke your mind and didn’t give no f****. You were the one that said what needed to be said, loud and clear. I miss you and wish I was able to drink one more fountain drink with you, lol (wink wink)...</p>
